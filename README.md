# Hi

I'm Idorenyin Udoh, a Frontend Engineer and Technical Writer.

For over three years, I've specialized in building experiences on the web that are efficient and decently captivating. I've mostly worked on these solutions using Vue and Nuxt as I'd taken a keen interest in Vue and its ecosystem just after I started coding in 2020. This has also led me to contribute to libraries, packages, and docs within the Vue ecosystem. As a result, open-source is something I'm quite passionate about. I just recently started getting into React and its ecosystem because I aim to be a fully-fledged frontend engineer. I know that would require a lot of work but I've been enjoying the process thus far.

JavaScript frameworks aside, I've gotten to realize that two aspects of frontend engineering that I enjoy are optimizing for performance and improving SEO rankings. I like to think I'm performance-obsessed and it's fulfilling to see something I worked on turn up among the first few results on SERPs. Also, two other aspects of engineering I'm interested in are blockchain and creative development.

Also, if you haven't figured out by now (I hope you figured out), I write really well. This, and the fact that I enjoy sharing what I learn, is why I got into technical writing. Oh, and I was curious how lucrative it could be. Since then, I have written for various blogs, contributed to some docs, and even written some myself. Some of my articles have garnered thousands of views. However, I try to consistently publish frontend-related articles on [my Medium](https://medium.com/@idorenyinudoh10) because technical writing is something I happen to be good at and, like I mentioned earlier, I enjoy sharing what I learn. Mostly so others don't have to go through the tedious process I went through while I was learning myself.

Damn, that's a lot of text.

Rounding up, I would appreciate it if you could check out [my portfolio](https://iudoh.me).

I'm very much open to frontend engineering and technical writing opportunities.

PS: my hobbies include playing Call of Duty, reading non-fiction, video editing, cleaning/decluttering, and engaging in calisthenics exercises.
