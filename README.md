# Hi
I'm Idorenyin Udoh, a student-developer based in Ogun State, Nigeria.

I mostly do frontend stuff but I work with Node.js and MongoDB sometimes (that's backend, right?).

My stack includes: HTML, CSS, **Vanilla** JavaScript, Pug, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

I write too. I have [some articles on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/udohidorenyin).

I really don't like that Vanilla JavaScript gets so much *hate* due to the availability of frameworks.

I'm currently learning Vue because I actually want to see how a framework eases web development. Asides that, I like Evan You and I need a job (lmao).

I have a Twitter account but you can reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/idorenyinudoh/) or [email](mailto:idorenyinudoh10@outlook.com).
