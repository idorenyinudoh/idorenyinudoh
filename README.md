# Hi

I'm Idorenyin Udoh, a Frontend Engineer and Technical Writer.

For over three years, I've specialized in building experiences on the web that are efficient and decently captivating. I've mostly worked on these solutions using Vue and Nuxt as I'd taken a keen interest in Vue and its ecosystem just after I started coding in 2020. This has also led me to contribute to libraries, packages, and docs within the Vue ecosystem. As a result, open-source is something I'm quite passionate about. I just recently started writing React because I aim to be a fully-fledged frontend engineer. I know that would require a lot of work but I've been enjoying the process thus far.

JavaScript frameworks aside, I've gotten to realize that two aspects of frontend engineering that I enjoy are optimizing for performance and improving SEO rankings. I like to think I'm performance-obsessed and it's fulfilling to see something I worked on turn up among the first few results on SERPs.
